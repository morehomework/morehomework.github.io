				<h1>Euro Truck Simulator 2</h1>
				<p>Welcome to Euro Truck Simulator 2, which is based upon real-world haulage in a free-formed environment. My goal with Euro Truck 
				Simulator 2, indeed with other games, is to play realistically. See some of my most recent episodes, and view the Euro Truck Simulator 2 
				series playlist if you wish to see more.</br></br>You may also browse through the entire series, if you desire, <a href="">here</a>.</p>

				<h1>Programme Schedule</h1>
				<p>I post a new video everyday. As such, one can watch my videos much in the same way as multiple television programmes. Therefore,
				to enable this, I have set forth a schedule of video postings. This schedule is most certainly subject to change.</p>

				<h1>F.A.Q.</h1>
				<h4>Frequently Asked Questions!</h4>
				<p><b>1. Question: Where are your PC Specs?</b></br>
				Answer: I understand that many people would absolutely enjoy the ability to replicate my videos, and play in the same way I do (with some personal
				modification of course). Therefore, I have made my P.C. Specifications transparent, and available for viewing, at the <a href="#">PC Specs Page</a>.</p>
				<p><b>2. Question: How can I support your channel?</b></br>
				First of all, I would like to commend you on your support. All support, regardless of its form is invaluable, and I greatly appreciate it. If it is
				possible within your personal budget, a small donation is wonderful for being able to maintain a consistent channel. However, if this is not possible,
				I understand completely. Additionally, a subscription to the channel adds popularity, further increasing the channel's ability to grow. Finally,
				comments on certain videos, likes, and dislikes are, surprisingly, very helpful in gauging proper video content for the viewing majority. I would like
				to emphasise that your comments <u>most certainly do count</u>.</p>
				<p><b>3. Question: What if I don't have enough money to donate?</b></br>
				Answer: As I mentioned in the last answer, I appreciate your support, especially when it comes in the form of a comment, a like, or a dislike on a video, 
				as they allow me to measure and quantify the happiness with a certain video. Thank <i>you!</i></p>
				<p><b>4. Question: Where can I find the maps/mods that you have in your videos?</b></br>
				Answer: All of the maps that I use in my Let's Play series are listed with a link in the video descriptions for each episode within the series. Any 
				significant mods that I use in a specific episode range may be listed with a link. In the event that you cannot find a mod listing in a video description,
				any mods that I use in videos are relatively easy to find with Google. I appreciate your understanding.</p>
				<p><b>5. Question: Can you do Farming Simulator 2015 Multi-player?</b></br>
				Answer: First, I would like to preface this answer with the fact that I would love to be more connected with my viewers, and I am sure the reverse is true. 
				Unfortunately, however, the internet connection in my region is quite poor, and multi-player is simply not possible without sustaining large amounts of 
				frame-rate lag. To give you a quick reference of how poor my internet connection is, consider the fact that one 20-30 minute video will take approximately 
				12-14 hours to upload to YouTube (I must leave my laptop running all night). Iâ€™m very sorry about this sad fact, but it may change in the future. However, 
				multi-player is simply not possible at the moment.</p>
				<p><b>6. Question: Why don't you respond to some YouTube comments?</b></br>
				Answer: First of all, I would like to thank you on your comments, as they really do help. However, if your comment extends no further than 'great vid', I
				tend not to answer those, as there would only be 'thank you' in response. I appreciate your kinds words, and, while it may not be explicitly replied to, a
				thank you is certainly implied. However, if you have suggestions in your comments, I shall do my utmost to reply to them adequately and note them.</p>
